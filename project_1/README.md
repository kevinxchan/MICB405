# To whoever is marking this...

To run `master.sh` successfully, you must pass in a working directory (absolute path) which stores all the analysis files, the absolute path to the data directory, and the `sample_names.txt` file included in this repo.

Note that this script doesn't cleanup any intermediate files, so ensure there is enough disk space before running.
